        <p class="about_other_item">When you think about Four Seasons, we hope unparalleled luxury comes to mind. But what is luxury, really? Our answer may surprise you.</p>
        <p class="about_other_item">To us, true luxury is a meaningful sense of belonging. It is a dedicated focus on how people want to be treated, grounded in the genuine care you experience during your stay and defined by an abundance of humanity and generosity. This starts with our passionate team, welcoming you to be the centre of our world, anywhere in the world – and always with a distinctly human touch.</p>
