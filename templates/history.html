            <div class="history_period_description">Isadore (Issy) Sharp had no plans to enter the hotel business on a grand scale when the young architect and builder – working with his contractor father, Max Sharp – constructed his first hotel. Over the course of this decade, he opened three Four Seasons hotels. Sharp’s experience would pave the way for the creation of a new kind of hotel, one focused solely on the guest.</div>

            <div class="history_date_date">1961</div>
            <div class="history_date_description">The first Four Seasons hotel opened on the first day of spring in 1961 on an unlikely downtown site in Toronto, Canada. It had taken more than five years for Issy Sharp, still in his 20s, to convince backers of his vision. Yet, from the start, the 125-room motor hotel showed the hallmark of Four Seasons – a more personal style of service. “We opened our first hotel with a simple principle: treating every customer as a special guest.” Issy Sharp was both the developer and the builder of the hotel, with his original partners, Murray Koffler, Max Sharp, Eddie Creed and Fred Eisen.</div>

            <div class="history_date_description">In 1963, Four Seasons opened its second hotel, Toronto’s Inn on the Park. Sharp again commissioned Peter Dickinson, the architect responsible for the innovative design of his first Four Seasons hotel two years before. Perched on a hill above hectares of parkland, and boasting one of the city’s top restaurants, the sophisticated urban resort-style hotel was an instant success. Towards the end of the decade the company opened a third hotel, leading to more significant expansion in the 1970s.</div>

            <div class="history_period_description">The 1970s began with a defining moment – the opening of a hotel in London, England. This hotel set the tone for the future direction of the company and pioneered many of the signature Four Seasons services now delivered worldwide. Within a few years, the company’s portfolio also included 10 hotels across Canada, and its first US management contracts, in San Francisco and Chicago. By the close of the decade, Four Seasons had entered the US market under its own brand name in Washington, DC.</div>

            <div class="history_date_description">In 1970, Inn on the Park London (later renamed Four Seasons Hotel London at Park Lane) opened, right at the start of the transatlantic jet-travel boom. A chance meeting in the mid-1960s had introduced Issy Sharp to a British family with a Hyde Park-area property and a plan for a hotel. They felt that there were enough grand hotels in London, and wanted to create a no-frills alternative. Sharp had a different vision: “A personal, down-to-earth hotel. Not for dukes or duchesses, but for people who want to be treated that way, and are put off by the stuffy formality of traditional grand hotels.” His skeptical British partners were eventually won over. Although competing with famous names like the Savoy, the new hotel was virtually always full. London’s Inn on the Park became Europe’s hotel of the year.</div>

            <div class="history_date_description">The second key strategic decision that formed the business platform was about service. By the mid-1970s, the company had turned its sights to the south. Cracking this market would require an edge, and Four Seasons decided to make that edge, service – the exceptional service that had made the London hotel so successful. Thus, the second pillar of the business platform was laid: True luxury is defined not by architecture or décor, but by service. So Four Seasons made the quality of our service our distinguishing feature and a competitive advantage.</div>

            <div class="history_period_description">The 1980s unveiled flagship hotels in a dozen US cities, including Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, Los Angeles and Chicago. Four Seasons as a distinct brand name was coming into its own. Divesting less-strategic properties, the company began to transform itself from a hotel owner-operator into a management company. It also started to manage hotels in mixed-use developments – a new concept at the time – allowing it to extend its expertise into high-quality residential environments.</div>

            <div class="history_date_description">The third of the four strategic decisions that formed the business platform was about culture. Four Seasons had always had an implicit operating philosophy. As the company expanded, Issy Sharp decided to make it explicit. He knew that shared values were essential to the service culture he wanted to create. Therefore, he and his team developed a formal credo, founded on the Golden Rule: We treat others – all others: customers, employees, partners, suppliers – as one would wish to be treated. This became the cornerstone of Four Seasons culture. Today, embraced by all employees from Nevis to Cairo, the company’s goals, beliefs and principles embody what the world thinks of as Four Seasons service.</div>

            <div class="history_date_date">1981</div>
            <div class="history_date_description">Issy Sharp was one of the first corporate sponsors when Terry Fox began his courageous Marathon of Hope in 1980. Despite having lost a leg to cancer, Terry was proposing to run across Canada, from coast to coast, to raise money for cancer research. Long before Terry's run captured the imagination of the country, Sharp pledged $10,000 to Terry's cause, and personally wrote to another 999 Canadian corporations to urge them to do the same. However, after 143 days – with Terry running a marathon a day – Terry's cancer returned and he was forced to stop before completing his challenge. Sharp immediately sent a telegram to the Fox family to promise that an annual run would be held in Terry's name. Terry pinned Issy's telegram to his hospital bed – and had its message read out to Canadians on national television. Four Seasons then worked closely with the Canadian Cancer Society and other sponsors to plan the first Terry Fox Fun Run in 1981. It drew more than 300,000 Canadian participants and raised $3.2 million. To date, Four Seasons employees have raised millions of dollars for cancer research in Toronto and in markets around the globe where it operates. Held each September in more than 50 countries, the Terry Fox Run is now the world's largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research, and has raised over CAD $750 million worldwide.</div>

Introducing travellers to attentive, round-the-clock Four Seasons service in a leisure setting, Four Seasons Resort and Club Dallas was a first, for both the company and the industry. Also in Dallas, golf was another first for Four Seasons in 1986. Four Seasons has gone on to create some of the top spas and golf courses in the world.</div>
